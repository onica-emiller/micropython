# IoTanium DevKit PREVIEW Firmware
---
## Boot workflow:
- **Button not held during boot:**
    - Attempts to connect to all wlans configured in `iotanium_cfg.json` on the filesystem
    - Skips configured wlans that are not in range of the device
    - If no config exists, or all wlan connections fail, enables the AP
    - Runs boot.py and main.py (if it exists) automatically
- **Button held during boot:**
    - skips connecting to wlans
    - enables the AP
    - enables webrepl
    - skips boot.py and main.py
    
In either case where the device enters AP mode, the onboard LED located just above the button will blink rapidly for 5 seconds.

## Instructions for use/testing firmware:

### Flash your device
1. Clone this repository
1. Flash device with the firmware found at `micropython/ports/esp32/build/firmware.bin` (in the same directory as this README)

### Connect your workstation to device AP
1. On first boot, observe the device enter AP mode (onboard LED blinks rapidly for 5 seconds)
1. Connect your workstation to WLAN with SSID `IoTanium-<device MAC address>`, password `iotanium`

### Connect to webrepl and upload your wifi credentials
1. Open `micropython/webrepl/webrepl.html` in a browser
1. In the webrepl, connect to the default target `ws://192.168.4.1:8266/` password is `iotanium`
1. Edit the file in the repo `micropython/iotanium_cfg.json` with your wifi connection information, and **save the file**
1. Use the webrepl's `Choose File > Send To Device` feature to upload `iotanium_cfg.json` to the device.  (ensure you are successfully authenticated in step 2. above, or file transfer will fail)

### Connect your device to wifi
1. In the webrepl console, run `iotanium.setup()` and observe the output, similar to that below:
```
>>> iotanium.setup()
config file ./iotanium_cfg.json found
wifi scanning
found wlan MY_WIFI
connecting to wlan home office/MY_WIFI...
connection to wlan home office/MY_WIFI successful! To continue:
1. reconnect your workstation to wifi network: MY_WIFI
2. once reconnected, connect to webrepl on:
ws://192.168.1.243:8266/                               
>>>   
```
2. Make a note of the webrepl target in your output, similar to: `ws://192.168.1.243:8266/` (your output will be the same format, but a different address)

### Connect to your device over wifi
1. Disconnect from the AP, and reconnect to your local WIFI
2. **Refresh** the webrepl client in your browser, and reconnect to the target noted above, password `iotanium`
3. You should now be connected to your device via webrepl over your wifi:
```
Welcome to MicroPython!
Password: <masked>
WebREPL connected
>>>
```

### Test Safe Mode Button Behavior
1. Connect to device via serial to observe console logging
2. Test button press during boot to validate device skips wifi and enables AP
4. Test expected execution of `boot.py` & `main.py` with/without button press

### Test IoTanium helper functions
```
>>>iotanium.led('on')
>>>iotanium.led('off')
>>>iotanium.blink(100,10) #delay in milliseconds, duration in seconds
>>>iotanium.hall() #hold magnet close to ESP32 chip to change reading
>>>iotanium.temp() #value is crude, not calibrated to anything, and only changes in small increments
>>>iotanium.touch() #capacitive touch on pin 12
>>>iotanium.read_all() #returns {"touch": 414, "hall": 74, "temp": 126}
```
